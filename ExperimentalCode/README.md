# Overview
The code is based on a single loop object-iterating architecture. We take advantage of the LabVIEW Object Oriented Programming (LVOOP) to ensure code order, supportability,and quick testing.
For details on the architecture please review the document "How it's made.pdf" that is included in the root of this repository.
